# push_swap
Supposedly fun but not fun project

Ok, im tyring to figure out how to do something silly that obviously have other easier way to do it.

So, all the ft_lst commands are storing a void pointer, im thinking how i can use void pointer to store my int.
	- I could iterate thru the input list and for every number, i use atoi to convert to int than malloc to store it. This all can be done when creating the stack.
